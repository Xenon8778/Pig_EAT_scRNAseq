Single-cell RNA seq analysis of Pig Epicardial Adipose Tissue 
# Pig Epicardial Adipose Tissue scRNAseq
This repository contains the codes for processing the single-cell RNA sequencing data of Epicardial Adipose Tissue (EAT) from Sus scrofa (Pig). Animals were divided into two exercise (sedentary vs exercised) and two coronary artery (non-occluded and occluded) treatment groups.

## Significance
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death in women. However, the role of the adipose tissue surrounding coronary arteries (EAT) in the development of CAD in females and how exercise, which is recommended to slow CAD progression, impacts EAT are unknown. The impact of exercise on gene expression in EAT was investigated with RNA-sequencing, revealing significant alterations in various cellular and immunoregulatory processes. This study provides valuable insights into the molecular and cellular changes induced in EAT by exercise in the context of chronic ischemic heart disease in females. These findings contribute to the understanding of the impact of exercise on cardiac health in females and provide a foundation for future research in the field of exercise science.

## Additional Code
A function to auto-annotate clusters using the scType Database (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28803-w) that was used to sub-cluster cell types.
