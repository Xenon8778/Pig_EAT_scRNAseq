# Pig Epicardial Adipose Tissue scRNAseq
This repository contains the codes for processing the single-cell RNA sequencing data of Epicardial Adipose Tissue (EAT) from Sus scrofa (Pig) over 4 treatment conditions.

## Significance
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death in women. However, the role of the adipose tissue surrounding coronary arteries (EAT) in the development of CAD in females and how exercise, which is recommended to slow CAD progression, impacts EAT are unknown. The impact of exercise on gene expression in EAT was investigated with RNA-sequencing, revealing significant alterations in various cellular and immunoregulatory processes. This study provides valuable insights into the molecular and cellular changes induced in EAT by exercise in the context of chronic ischemic heart disease in females. These findings contribute to the understanding of the impact of exercise on cardiac health in females and provide a foundation for future research in the field of exercise science.
